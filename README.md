# Parks Modpack

***DISCLAIMER: THIS GITHUB PAGE IS STILL VERY NEW, THERE ARE MANY REMNANTS OF FABULOUSLY OPTIMIZEDS FILES ETC, THESE ARE NOT MADE BY ME AND FULL CREDIT TO THE FABULOUSLY OPTIMIZED TEAM. I AM WORKING ON REMOVING ALL THIS BUT FOR THE TIME BEING PLEASE DONT MIND IT***

A simple modpack for people who are used to having Forge and OptiFine and are curious to see what equivalents Fabric has to offer. You could consider this modpack a "starting point" to optimize your game before adding more functional mods or you could just play this as if it was vanilla - the choice is yours. 

The pack only adds performance and graphics enhancements to the client, so **it works on every world and server**.

## Disclaimers

By using this modpack, you agree to the following:

* The modpack has been set up to be compatible with the rules of most public third-party servers, but it is your responsibility to verify whether you are allowed to use it or not. By installing this modpack you agree that the modpack author, the mod developers and Mojang provide no warranties for using this modpack, every action you do with it is your own. 
   
    * The command *`/ghost`* (provided by [AntiGhost](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost)) may be disallowed by the rules on some servers [as it sends a slight amount of packets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost?comment=103), but it is safe if you don't spam it, use only when you are stuck in blocks.
* This modpack is using [Starlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) for chunk optimization and [due to the way it works](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md#chunk-save-format), disabling (or replacing) the mod will make your existing worlds initially load a bit slower. This is harmless, it simply means the game is calculating the lit up areas again with a different algorithm.
* This modpack disables the [third-party server disclaimer](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Multiplayer_disclaimer.png), so if you are using the multiplayer function, you also agree to the following: 
    > Caution: Online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone. 

* [The "social interactions" screen](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Social_Interactions_screen#Usage) can be used by pressing the key `P` in-game or the `Social Interactions` button in the pause menu (coming soon), where players can ignore others' chat messages or block them with the Microsoft account entirely.

<summary>1.19.1 disclaimers - do not apply yet</summary>

However, chat reporting is disabled due to player security and privacy concerns ([simple explanation](https://youtu.be/rdoFUhd0EkI)/[timeline of events](https://youtu.be/kEfyaAq90kg)/[technical explanation](https://youtu.be/hYAUEMlugyw?t=43)). 
   * Chat reporting can be re-enabled by [disabling the mod](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/disabling-mods) called [No Chat Reports](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports).
   * you should follow the rules of the server you  play in, [Minecraft Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards) and all local laws. Any misconduct should be reported to the server administration and/or local police where necessary.
   * If you've gotten banned already, [see "How to submit a case review" here to appeal](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/community-standards#main-content).
